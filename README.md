###Project Title
Python Bikeshare Project

###Description
This project displays statistics about bikeshare programs in Chicago, New York City, and Washington DC

###Files used
Source Code: bikeshare_2.py
Data Files: chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, washington.csv

###Credits
Everything I know about git needs to be credited to Richard Kalehoff.  He deserves credit for his patience and enthusiasm.  I am inspired by him as it is tough teaching with emotion to a camera.

The bikeshare template came from Udacity.  The inserted code was all mine.
